## General Info
With this project I wanted to build my own cookie banner witch is free to use. I was not always happy about all the cookie banners solutions I´ve found online, either the banner wasn´t all that good or you needed an account to get access to the banner for implementation.

As an indie webdev and front-end developer I´ve decided to start building my own little banner and it evolved to this project.
This cookie banner is also available in diffrent language:

Available languages:
* German
* Danish
* English

You can read more about the cookie banner under: https://www.intastellarsolutions.com/solutions/cookie-consents (danish).
This banner is free to use as long as the powered by logo is not removed. We are glad if you want to contribuate to this project so we can develop it further and we can make it secure.

We support your own cookiebanner design. Just use our technology to block thrid party cookies.

## Development
If you want to develop on the banner you must do that in your own branch and in all *.dev.js files. You create your branch from the "development" branch, and merge your also into
that. The "cb(.dev).js" file is the function to create the banner via HTML and CSS and styling. The "gdpr(.dev).js" file is all the functionality of the banner
